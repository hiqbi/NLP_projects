# SD-TSIA214 - Machine Learning for Text Mining

This repository is dedicated to labs done within the course SD-TSIA214 at Télécom Paris 2022/2023. 

## Lab 1 - Word Embeddings

- The goal of this lab is to get familiar with word embeddings and to use them for text classification.
- The dataset used is the IMDB reviews dataset.
- Different document representations are explpored : BoW, TF-iDF, the co-occurence matrix, Word2Vec and GloVe.

## Lab 2 - Neural Models

- The goal of this lab is to get familiar with neural models (using `pytorch`) for text classification.
- The lab consists mainly of training NNs, with and without fine-tuning the words representation (GloVe embeddings).
